# Codsoft_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Python-ML

ðŸš¢ Project Overview: Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic disaster of 1912 remains one of the most infamous maritime tragedies in history. In this project, I used real-world passenger data from the Kaggle Titanic       Dataset to predict which passengers were likely to survive the sinking of the ship.

The goal of this project is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to:
  Analyze passenger information such as age, sex, class, fare, etc.
  Clean and preprocess the data
  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Build a predictive model using Logistic Regression

This project was completed as part of my Virtual Internship at CodSoft under the Data Science track, and it gave me hands-on experience with end-to-end model building.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used:
  Python
  Pandas
  Matplotlib, Seaborn
  Scikit-learn
  Jupyter Notebook
  KaggleHub

âœ… Key Outcomes:
  Identified important features influencing survival
  Achieved predictive accuracy using logistic regression
  Created visualizations to better understand survival trends by gender, age, and class
